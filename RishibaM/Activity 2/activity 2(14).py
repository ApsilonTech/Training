#14. What Is The Output Of The Following Python Code Fragment? Justify
#Your Answer.
 #A.list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
 #print(list[10:])
'''
it shows as empty list[]because index 10 is not the list
'''
 #B.for var in ["mon","tue","wed","Thu","Fri"]:
 # if (var == "wed"):
 #continue
 # else:
 # print(var)
'''
it was print the "mon","tue","thu","fri" the statement are continue so "wed" not print
'''
 #C.Logfiles = ("Test1.log","Test2.log","Test3.log","Test4.log")
 #if("Test2.log" not in Logfiles):
 #print("Found")
 #else:
 #print("NOT-FOUND")
'''
output will be  not- found it was using the membership operators which  compare to the in(or)not in
'''
 #D.v="root:x:/bin/bash-123:text:bin:text"
 #v.split("/")[-1]
'''
it was empty because not using the print
'''
 #E.weekdays = ['sun','mon','tue','wed','thu'','fri','sun','mon','mon']
 #print (weekdays.count('mon'))

'''
the no.of weekdays count will be'mon':3
'''
 #F.
testList  = [1, 3, 5]
testList.sort (reverse=True)
print(testList)
'''
the testlist  will be reverse 5,3,1  it was using the reverse statement of the testlist
'''
